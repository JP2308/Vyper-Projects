## A collection of Vyper-based smart contracts and scripts for learning and experimentation.

### Overview

This repository contains various Vyper scripts and smart contracts, including:

`first_vyper_code.vy`: A simple introductory contract demonstrating basic Vyper syntax and functionality.

`buy_me_a_coffee.vy`: A smart contract that allows users to send Ether as a token of appreciation.

These examples are designed to help developers understand the fundamentals of Vyper and smart contract development on the Ethereum blockchain.
